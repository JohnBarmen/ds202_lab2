```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

1) the distribution seems skewed to the left  

2) seems like countries that would have the most chocolate processing/production get the most ratings  

3) I think that there will be a preference in 70% since that is what most companies are making  

4) I an sure that some places of origin will just have superior cocoa beans as many things factor into a good bean, and some countries are just more suited than others.

5) id like to see the distributions of cocoa percentages, and to see how ingredients play a role in ratings
